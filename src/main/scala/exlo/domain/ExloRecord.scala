/**
 * Framework's metadata wrapper for user data records written to Iceberg.
 *
 * This is NOT what users emit - users emit simple strings. The framework wraps
 * user strings with this metadata before writing to Iceberg tables.
 *
 * Enables:
 * - Traceability: Track which connector/sync produced each record
 * - Idempotency: Detect duplicate commits via commitId
 * - Lineage: Understand data provenance via metadata fields
 *
 * @param commitId
 *   Unique ID for this commit batch
 * @param connectorId
 *   User's connector identifier (e.g., "shopify.orders")
 * @param syncId
 *   Unique ID for this sync execution
 * @param committedAt
 *   When record was committed to Iceberg
 * @param recordedAt
 *   When record was extracted from source
 * @param connectorVersion
 *   User's connector version
 * @param connectorConfigHash
 *   Hash of connector configuration
 * @param streamConfigHash
 *   Hash of stream configuration
 * @param stateVersion
 *   State version this record belongs to
 * @param payload
 *   User's record string - never deserialized by framework
